# Calling in sick: impacts of fever on intra-urban human mobility

Corresponding author: [Alex Perkins](mailto:taperkins@nd.edu)

This repository contains code to document and reproduce the workflow for the paper titled "Calling in sick: impacts of fever on itra-urban human mobility."

The main workflow for the analysis is contained within the script `./code/estimateParameters.R`, which makes calls to other scripts within the `./code/` folder.

Most data used in the analysis are available in `./data/` and on Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.rd66f), but some have been excluded due to the sensitive personal nature of those data. Any analyses that depend on data that have not been included in this repository have been commented out in `estimateParameters.R`, although all code is made available for the sake of transparency about the methods and analysis.
